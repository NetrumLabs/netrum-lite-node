# 🧠 What is Netrum Lite Node CLI?

 - Netrum Lite Node CLI is a lightweight command-line tool that allows anyone to participate in the Netrum decentralized compute network.
 - It securely creates a wallet, connects to the Netrum server, registers the node on-chain, syncs uptime data, mines NPT tokens, and allows daily token claiming — all from your terminal.

 - Ideal for VPS and low-resource devices, this node is designed for fast setup, full transparency, and passive token rewards.
